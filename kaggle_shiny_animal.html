Many animals are&nbsp;given up as unwanted by&nbsp;their owners, while others are picked up after getting&nbsp;lost or taken out&nbsp;of cruelty situations. Many of these animals&nbsp;find forever families to take them home, but just as many are not so lucky. 2.7 million dogs and cats are euthanized in the US every year.</p>

<p>Using a dataset of intake information including breed, color, sex, and age from the <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/department/animal-services" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Austin Animal Center</a>, we're asking Kagglers to predict the outcome for each animal.</p>
<p>We also believe this dataset can help us understand trends in animal outcomes. These insights&nbsp;could help shelters focus their energy on specific animals who need a little extra help finding a&nbsp;new home. We encourage you to publish your insights on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/scripts" rel="nofollow">Scripts</a>&nbsp;so they are publicly accessible.</p>
